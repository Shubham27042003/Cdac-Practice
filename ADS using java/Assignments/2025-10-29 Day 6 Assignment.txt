Assignments
1. Write recursive algorithm to find quotient after dividing two numbers.
   Using above definition, implement following function to return quotient after dividing two numbers (a / b).
int quotient(int a, int b);
   Follow up: Modify implementation/Implement wrapper function to handle both positive and negative numbers.

2. Write recursive algorithm to find remainder after dividing two numbers.
   Using above definition, implement following function to return remainder after dividing two numbers (a % b).
int remainder(int a, int b);
   Follow up: Modify implementation/Implement wrapper function to handle both positive and negative numbers.

3. Implement following funtion to "optimally" multiple two numbers, recursively. Handle both negative and positive numbers.
int multiply(int a, int b);
