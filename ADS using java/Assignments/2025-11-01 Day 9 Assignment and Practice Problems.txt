Assignment
1. Implement the following function to find an element in an unsorted array, using linear search.
boolean findUsingLinearSearch(int[] arr, int element);

2. Implement the following function to find an element in a sorted array, using binary search.
boolean findUsingBinarySearch(int[] arr, int element);
Hint: Sort the array using the sorting algorithm implemented below.

3. Implement the following function to sort the given array in descending order, using Bubble Sort
void bubbleSort(int[] arr);
Use the algorithm described in class to start from left side of array, to move smallest element towards the right end.

4. Implement the following function to sort the given array in descending order, using Insertion Sort
void insertionSort(int[] arr);

5. Implement the following function to check if given array elements are sorted or not.
boolean isArraySorted(int[] arr);
Hint: Use logic used in bubble sort.
