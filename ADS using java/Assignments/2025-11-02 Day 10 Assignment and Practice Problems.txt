Assignment
1. Implement following function to sort the given array in descending order, using merge sort
public void mergeSort(int[] arr)

2. Implement following function to sort the given array in descending order, using quick sort
public void quickSort(int[] arr)

3. Implement following function to sort the given array in descending order, using heap sort
public void heapSort(int[] arr)

4. Implement a hash table class in which each bucket is implemented as a linked list.
Use the linked list class that is implemented earlier in module for this implementation.


5: Implement printBFS() method in AdjListGraph class (code written in class today).
The method should traverse graph using BFS and print the vertices.
Graph data will be stored in an adjacency list.


Exercise 1: Modify MakeMaxHeap algorithm covered in class to remove tail recursion.
